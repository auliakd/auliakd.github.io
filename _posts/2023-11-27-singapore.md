### **Arrival — Day 1**

The first steps outside the airport felt different.  
The air was clean. The atmosphere was organized.  
People walked with calm confidence.  
I paused — not because I was confused, but because I was quietly absorbing everything.

That day, I checked in at **Spacepod @ Lavender**, a small capsule hotel.  
It was simple, warm, and exactly what I needed after traveling.

I rested.  
I let myself breathe.  
And in that silence, I whispered softly:

> *"Grow — slowly, softly, but continuously."*

### **Day 1 Evening — Quiet Space to Reset**

The capsule felt like my own little cocoon.  
A place to reset.  
A place to be still with my thoughts.

Even though I didn’t do much on the first day,  
my mind was already learning something new:

> **Peace is also progress.**

### **Day 2 — A Little Adventure Begins**

We woke up early to visit **NTU** and **NUS**.  
But of course — adventure comes with stories 😄
Our group got *lost* trying to find NTU.  
Nearly **two hours** of rerouting, guessing, asking strangers, trying again.

The funny part is:
most of us weren’t confident speaking English,  
but we held onto one motto:




> **"Malu bertanya sesat di jalan."**

So we asked.  
Smiled awkwardly.  
Got confused again.  
Laughed.  
And kept going.

And eventually — we made it.  
Tired, a little embarrassed, but *proud*.

Sometimes the journey teaches more than the destination.

### **Merlion & Gardens by the Bay**

Later that evening, we visited Merlion and Gardens by the Bay.  
I didn’t take many photos.  
I just let myself *exist* there — present and quiet.

City lights reflecting on the water.  
The warm breeze.  
People laughing.  
Life moving gently.

In that moment, I felt small —  
but in a way that opened space inside me.

### **Reflection 🌿**
Singapore didn’t change me overnight.  
But it showed me something:

There is a version of me  
who is more confident, calmer, and more open to the world —  
and she is possible.

### **Note to My Future Self**
If one day you return here,  
come as someone who has grown enough to say:

> *"Thank you, for inspiring me to try harder — softly, but consistently."*
