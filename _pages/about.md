I am a Project Control Administrator at PT. Surya Mas Perkasa (Karawang), supporting project control, documentation, and data management in engineering-based project environments.

Previously, I served as a Project Manager at Pro Knowledge Indonesia and worked as a Researcher in the Department of Information Systems, UIN Sultan Syarif Kasim Riau. I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Information Systems at UIN Sultan Syarif Kasim Riau in 2025, supervised by Dr. Saide.

My interests focus on the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Knowledge Management within Project Management Information Systems (PMIS). I am particularly interested in how AI can enhance decision support, collaboration, and project efficiency in organizational settings.

I work at the boundary between research and practice, contributing to digital transformation and project innovation through systems-oriented thinking and data-driven project workflows.
