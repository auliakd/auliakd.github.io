*Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* is the first book in the **Harry Potter** series by **J. K. Rowling**.  
It follows the story of an orphaned boy who discovers that he is a wizard and is invited to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

I'm currently reading this book. I love how the story feels warm and full of curiosity, with a touch of humor.  
The magical world feels alive, like a place that could exist just outside our everyday reality.

### 💭 Current Reflections
- Hogwarts feels like a place that understands you, even before you understand yourself.
- The theme of **friendship** shows up early: loyalty, bravery, and standing up for each other.
- This book reminds me that family isn’t always about blood. Sometimes, it's about who stays by your side.

Since I am still reading, this reflection may develop later.
