### Overview
**SMARTech DCS IVENSTORY** is a **prototype web-based inventory management system** developed as part of my internship program at **PT. Riau Andalan Pulp and Paper (RAPP)** in 2023.  
The project aimed to simulate an internal system for tracking inventory flow — recording the movement of goods in and out of storage facilities.

### My Role
As an **intern web developer**, I was responsible for designing the system interface and developing its main functionalities. My tasks included front-end development, database design, and testing system workflows.

### Technologies Used
- **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Back-end:** PHP, MySQL  
- **Tools:** Visual Studio Code, XAMPP, phpMyAdmin

### Key Contributions
- Created a responsive layout for the inventory dashboard.  
- Built CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) features for data management.  
- Designed a relational database structure to support item tracking.  
- Conducted internal testing and documentation for the system prototype.

### Outcome
Although the website was not officially launched, the project provided valuable hands-on experience in **system analysis, database integration, and full-stack web development**, strengthening my practical understanding of information system workflows.
