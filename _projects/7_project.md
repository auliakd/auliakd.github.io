### Overview
**Project Pro English** is an ongoing English communication program focused on improving participants’ **speaking, listening, reading, and debating skills** through practical and interactive sessions.  
I participated in this program for **1 year and 3 months**, during which I developed strong communication confidence, fluency, and teamwork in an English-speaking environment.

### Program Activities
The program involved various interactive learning activities designed to strengthen different aspects of English proficiency:

- **Conversation Practice:** Regular discussions on daily and professional topics to enhance fluency and confidence.  
- **English Debate Sessions:** Engaging in structured debates to improve critical thinking, reasoning, and persuasive communication.  
- **Reading & Listening Exercises:** Analyzing articles, podcasts, and short clips to sharpen comprehension and vocabulary.  
- **Question & Response Training:** Practicing spontaneous answers to strengthen articulation under time pressure.
